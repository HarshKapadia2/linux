    -   Minix
        -   Tanenbaum initially created the [Minix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix) Operating System for educational purposes.
        -   Anil also told us how Minix was found inside the [Intel Management Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine), which was a big deal, as Minix, whose goal was never to have military-grade security, was being used on billions of machines at a privilege level that is higher than the kernel, and that made billions of machines vulnerable. Also, this implies that Minix is the most used OS on the planet.

-   Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs)
    -   `x86`, `80x86` `IA-32`, `i386`, `i686`, `x86-32`
        -   `x86` refers to the Intel processor architecture that was used in PCs. Model numbers were 8088 (16-bit processor), 8086 (16-bit processor), 286, 386, 486.
        -   16-bit processors: 8086, 8088
        -   32-bit processors: 80386, 80486
            -   This is how the name `80x86` was born and over time the `80` was dropped, simplifying the name to just `x86`.
            -   32-bit processor implies a processor that is capable of addressing (accessing/working on) `2^32` bits of memory, which is around 4GB.
        -   Nowadays it roughly means any CPU with a 32-bit Intel compatible instruction set (usually anything from Pentium onwards). (Classic)
        -   Strictly speaking, `x86` covers all CPUs that are backwards-compatible with 8086 and all extensions to the architecture including `x86-32` and `x86-64`.
    -   `x64`, `x86_64`, `x86-64`, `amd64`, `AMD64`
        -   `x64` is the architecture name for the extensions to the x86 instruction set that enable 64-bit code.
        -   `x64` means a CPU that is x86 compatible but has a 64-bit mode as well.
        -   The well-known 64-bit instruction set processors.
            -   64-bit processor implies a processor that is capable of addressing (accessing/working on) `2^64` bits of memory, which is around 16EB.
    -   `IA64`, `IA-64`, `Itanium`
        -   **Not `x86`**, but is Intel's 64-bit architecture that failed to catch on unlike `amd64`.
    -   `x32`
        -   `x32` is an [Application Binary Interface (ABI)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2171177/what-is-an-application-binary-interface-abi) for amd64/x86_64 CPUs using 32-bit integers, longs and pointers.
        -   Fairly new variant of `x86-64` and not widely used. Not to be confused with legacy/classic 32-bit instruction sets.
        -   Registers are 64 bits, but pointers are only 32 bits, saving a lot of memory in pointer-heavy workflows. It also ensures all the other 64-bit only processor features are available.
