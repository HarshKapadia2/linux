        -   Anil also told us how Minix was found inside the [Intel Management Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine), which was a big deal, as Minix, whose goal was never to have military-grade security, was being used on billions of machines at a privilege level that is higher than the kernel, and that made billions of machines vulnerable. Also, this implies that Minix is the most used OS on the planet.
